HTML Form Implementation Assignment

 Project Overview
This repository contains my implementation of a semantic HTML form based on assignment specifications.  
The focus of this project is semantic HTML5 structure, form functionality, and accessibility.

Purpose of the Form
The form is designed to:
- Collect personal information
- Capture account details
- Allow users to set preferences

Sections are grouped using `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` for clarity and accessibility.
